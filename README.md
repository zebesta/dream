# Dream

A simple Angular 2 based front end to provide a user interface for deep dreams on audio spectrograms get resynthesized into audio for deep-learning generated audio effects.

A collaboration with [@markostam](https://github.com/markostam) on his Python / Tensor Flow based deep learning [program](https://github.com/markostam/audio-deepdream-tf)

Decided to replace this with a simple python flask [website](https://github.com/zebesta/audio-deepdream-tf) to avoid seperating front end from back end and a dynamic front end wasnt really necessary.
